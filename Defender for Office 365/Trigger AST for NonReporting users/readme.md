# Trigger Attack Simulation for non-reporting users

This playbook will execute using an incident based trigger and determine which mailboxes received malicious phishing emails, and calculate which users failed to perform a user submission (Report Message as Phish) to the SOC. It will trigger an Attack Simulator 'How-To Guide' simulation to educate these end-users on the correct response when receiving a Phish email in an inbox.
